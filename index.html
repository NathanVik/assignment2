<h2>A Short Biography</h2>

I grew up in <b>Indianapolis, IN</b> and attended Pike High School. After school I enlisted as a <i>Hospital Corpsman</i> in the Navy.
After serving my contract, I studied Forest and Natural Resource managment at the <b>University of Minnesota</b> in Saint Paul, MN. 
After obtaining my bachelor's degree, I worked as a natural resources consultant in northern California, and have recently moved back to Indiana
and started studying remotely at SDGKU.

My hobbies are video games and tabletop games, along with cooking and baking. I also spend a reasonable amount of time getting outside to hike and ski when the weather and travel permits.
